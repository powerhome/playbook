# Pages Folder

The `pages` folder is where the route-specific components or "views" of the application reside. Each file or subdirectory in this folder typically corresponds to a distinct part of the application and is associated with a specific URL route with our react-router. You can find the routes in `packs/app.js`. These page components are responsible for laying out the entire screen that a user will interact with within a given route, and they often compose various components from the `components` folder to build out the UI.

Please use this folder to organize your application's high-level page structure, ensuring that each page component encapsulates all the functionalities and elements necessary for the particular piece of the application it represents.
