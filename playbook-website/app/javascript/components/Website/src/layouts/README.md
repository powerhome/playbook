# Layouts Folder

The `layouts` folder contains components that define the overall page structure that can be reused across multiple pages. Layouts typically include headers, footers, sidebars, and any other consistent structure elements that provide a consistent look and feel across the application. These components are typically leveraged and used in the components in the `pages` folder.
