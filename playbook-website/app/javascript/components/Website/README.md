# Website Folder

This directory is the root of the React application. It houses the entire React frontend, encapsulating all the components, hooks, assets, and layouts necessary for the web interface. The entry point (`index.tsx`) of the React app is located here, which bootstraps the application and integrates it with the Rails views. 

See the READMEs of all the sub-folders:

- [assets](./src/assets/README.md)
- [components](./src/components/README.md)
- [hooks](./src/hooks/README.md)
- [layouts](./src/layouts/README.md)
- [pages](./src/pages/README.md)

The routes are located at: `packs/app.js`.
