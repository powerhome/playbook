### Utilizing Playbook Library 

**Figma's cutting edge tools**

This library allows designers to quickly build and customize UI. Every component created makes use of Figma’s advanced features like auto-layout, properties, and nested instances, ensuring precise design quality and efficiency. With this, components are instantly ready to use, with all variants included and available without the need to detach instances. In addition, global variables, typography styles, and color tokens allow for quick customizability throughout the entire library.

### Dependencies

The Playbook library is designed to work well with sans-serif fonts. You can easily replace the library’s current font with any font styles of your choosing and all components will update accordingly.

**Icons**

Playbook utilizes [Font Awesome 6 Pro](https://fontawesome.com/icons) for its icons. Font Awesome 6 Pro is a paid icon library font from Font Awesome. You can acquire it from Font Awesome or use their free font, Font Awesome 6 Free. Alternatively, you can replace Playbook icons with any icon library of your choice.
