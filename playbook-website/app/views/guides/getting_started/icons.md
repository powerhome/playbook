Icons are small graphical elements that represent actions, objects, or concepts in a user interface. They are a crucial part of a UI's visual language and help users understand and interact with the interface efficiently. Here's a detailed overview of what icons entail with Playbook:

**1. Navigation:** Icons are often used in navigation elements such as menus, toolbars, and tabs to indicate different sections or features of an application.
**2. Actions:** They can represent actions that users can take, such as "delete," "edit," "save," or "share."
**3. Status Indicators:** Icons can indicate the status of an item or process, such as loading, errors, warnings, or success states.
**4. Content Representation:** Icons can represent different types of content, such as documents, images, videos, or files.
**5. Feedback:** Icons can provide feedback to users, such as confirmation of an action, alert messages, or progress indicators.

Playbook allows integration with [Font Awesome icons](/guides/getting_started/icons/font_awesome/) as well as [custom icons](/kits/icon/rails#icon-custom).
