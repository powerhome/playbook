 <p>The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. <br>
     On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element. On non-replaced inline elements,<br>
    it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.</p>
