  The line-height property sets the height of a line box or the line itself text sits in.  <br>
  On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element. <br>
  On non-replaced inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.<br>
  Below are non-unit numbers used to indicate the space mulitplied by height of Font-family chosen. <br>
