Line graphs are used to show changes in data over time. The default height of line graph is 400px and can be changed. The default height is in pixel units, but can also use percentage string (percentage would be that of the width. For example, `height:"50%"` would mean that the height is 50% of the width). This allows for preserving the aspect ratio across responsive sizes.â€©
