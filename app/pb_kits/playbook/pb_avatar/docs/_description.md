Avatar displays a user's picture. This helps aid easy recognition of the user. This kit is normally not used by itself, but rather used within other kits.
The only time Avatar should be used instead of the User kit is when you are not going to display the user's name. An example of Avatar being used by itself would be the upper right hand corner of the Nitro nav bar.
