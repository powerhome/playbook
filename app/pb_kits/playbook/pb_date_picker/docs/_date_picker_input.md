The date picker is built with the text input kit.  Any text input prop you pass to the date picker kit with be forwarded to the input, with a few exceptions.  The `value` attribute is automatically handled and matched with whatever date string the input field contains.  You cannot pass a custom value prop.  The `id` prop will be passed to the date picker's parent div.  Instead the `pickerId` prop is passed directly to the input and is required to instatiate the date picker.

You must use `inputAria` or `input_aria` and `inputData` or `input_data` props if you wish to pass data or aria attributes to the text input kit.  If you use `data` or `aria` props they will be passed to the date picker kit itself instead.  Also be aware the default behavior of text input aria and data props is to pass those props to attributes on the wrapping div not on the input itself.
