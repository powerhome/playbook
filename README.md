# Playbook Design System

Playbook is the first design system built for both Rails & React interfaces. Inspired by [Velocity](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-resources/design-system-dashboard-ui-kit/), Playbook takes a modern design approach, and applies it in a way that makes it easy to support bleeding edge, or legacy systems. Playbook is built & maintained by the User Experience & Development teams at Power Home Remodeling, the largest home remodeler in the US.
