            This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
            recent activity. It will be closed in 24 hours if no further activity occurs.

            If this change is desirable, please accelerate completing it. If it is not,
            please close the PR. If you're blocked on something, please ensure there's
            a reference to this PR in a story on your team's board so the team will
            follow up, and consider closing the PR for now.

            Please do not artificially extend the deadline with a dummy comment. If
            necessary, provide a status update, such as "this change is being actively
            tested".

            Thank you for your contributions and your collaboration in reducing WIP
            and cycle time.
