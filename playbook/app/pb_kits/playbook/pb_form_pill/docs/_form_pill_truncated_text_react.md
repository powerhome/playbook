For Form Pills with longer text, the `truncate` global prop can be used to truncate the label within each Form Pill. Hover over the truncated Form Pill and a Tooltip containing the text or tag section of the Form Pill will appear. See [here](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/global_props/truncate) for more information on the truncate global prop.
