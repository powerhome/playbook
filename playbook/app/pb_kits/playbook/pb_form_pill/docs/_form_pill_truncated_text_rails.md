For Form Pills with longer text, the truncate global prop can be used to truncate the label within each Form Pill. See [here](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/global_props/truncate) for more information on the truncate global prop.

__NOTE__: For Rails Form Pills (not ones embedded within a React-rendered Typeahead or MultiLevelSelect), a unique `id` is required to enable the Tooltip functionality displaying the text or tag section of the Form Pill.
