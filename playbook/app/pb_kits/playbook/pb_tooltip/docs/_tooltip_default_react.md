You can define the tooltip placement sending the prop `placement` with one of the available options: `top | right | bottom | left`.

If you don't specify a desired `placement`, the component will automatically choose the one that fits better. 

If the desired `placement` doesn't fit on screen, the component will automatically switch to the one that fits better.
