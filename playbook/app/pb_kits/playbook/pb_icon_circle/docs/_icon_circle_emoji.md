The Icon Circle also allows you to pass in an HTML emoji in place of an icon if needed. To do so, pass any emoji or its hexa/decimal ref (see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp)) as a string to the `emoji` prop as shown in the code snippet below.

NOTE: the kit will only accept `icon` or `emoji` as a prop, not both together.
