The `form` kit provides consumers with a convenient, consistently styled `<form>` wrapper.

### Form Helpers

This kit uses rails `form_with` with our custom builder to render forms using other kits such as text_input, select, and typeahead to name a few. Doing so provides UI consistency within forms and makes adding a form to your page easier.
