This kit can be very versatile when used to display text data.

Variant `default` includes a label and text. However, variant `details` can be used if multiple elements are necessary in order to make it more descriptive. Variant `details` may include icon, light text, title and date, as well as the option to make it active (with link color) for clickability purposes.
