This kit uses the [Popover kit](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/popover/react) under the hood for the Filter Popover which comes with its own set of props. If you want to apply certain Popover props to that underlying kit, you can do so by using the optional `popoverProps` prop. This prop must be an object that contains valid Popover props. For a full list of Popover props, see [here](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/popover/react).
