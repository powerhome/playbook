By default, the filter popover attaches to the `<body>`. To attach it elsewhere, like inside a Turbo Frame, pass the `append_to` prop through `popover_props`. Set it to `"parent"` to place the tooltip inside its parent element, or pass any CSS selector (`#id` or `.class`) to specify a custom container.
