Our drawer kit can fulfill your responsive menu needs! Using the `closeBreakpoint` prop you can have the menu close on smaller screens like phones/tablets.

Set a menu button with  the `menuButtonID` props. When the Drawer is open, the menu button will be hidden. But when your Brakpoint closes the drawer, you can toggle the Drawer open/close with your menu butotn.

Also use the `withinElement` props to have the Drawer open within a specific element, instead of the default behavior of it taking up the entire screen size.
