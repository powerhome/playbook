Auto close is used when you want the confirmation toast to close automatically after a certain time. `auto_close` property will be a delay number in ms.

The script tag in this code snippet is for demonstration purposes only. It clones the toasts in order to have it appear with a button click prompt and not upon initial page load. In a typical production environment the event triggering a fixed confirmation toast to appear would be handled by a controller or a separate javascript file.
