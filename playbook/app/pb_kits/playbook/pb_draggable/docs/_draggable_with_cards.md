For a simplified version of the Draggable API for the Card kit, You can use the the Card kit as the Draggable Item by using the `draggableItem` prop. The dragHandle is added by default but this can be opted out of by setting `dragHandle` to false on the Card kit. 

In addition to the above `dragId` is a REQUIRED prop to be passedd to the Card kit when implementing dragging.

The dev must manage state as shown.
