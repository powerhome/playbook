For a simplified version of the Draggable API for the Card kit, You can use the the Card kit as the Draggable Item by using the `draggableItem` prop on Card. The dragHandle is added by default but this can be opted out off by setting `dragHandle` to false on the Card kit. 

The dev must manage state as shown and pass in id to the Card for dragging to work.
