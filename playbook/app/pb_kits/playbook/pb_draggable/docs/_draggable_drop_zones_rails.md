The Draggable kit lets you customize the style of drop zones that appear when dragging an item.

By default, drop zones are in the "ghost" style, but you can also choose from "shadow," "outline," and "line."

When using the "line" type, make sure to set the appropriate `direction` attribute on the `draggable/draggable_container` component based on the orientation of your draggable view: "vertical" or "horizontal." Note that the direction attribute only applies to the "line" type and does not affect other drop zone styles. For more on the "line" style in particular, check out the [Draggable Drop Zones Line doc example](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/draggable/rails#draggable-drop-zones-line).
