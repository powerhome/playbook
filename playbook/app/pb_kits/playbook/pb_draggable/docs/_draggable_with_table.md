The draggable kit can also be used in conjunction with the table kit to create draggable table rows. To do this:

- use the `draggable_container` prop on the table/table_body to designate it as the Draggable Container
- use the `draggable_item` prop on the table/table_row to designate it as the Draggable Item. Make sure to also pass id to the `drag_id` prop here.
