When using the "line" style, make sure to set the appropriate `direction` attribute within the `drop_zone_direction` prop on the `draggable/draggable_container` component based on the orientation of your draggable view: "vertical" or "horizontal." Note that the direction attribute only applies to the "line" style and does not affect other drop zone styles. Also, set the `drop_zone_line_color` prop on the `draggable/draggable_item` component to "primary" or "purple".

The length of the line is calculated based off of the width (for "vertical") or height (for "horizontal") of the parent container holding the draggable items.
