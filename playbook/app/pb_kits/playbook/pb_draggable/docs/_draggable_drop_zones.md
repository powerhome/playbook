The Draggable kit allows you to choose the style of drop zones that appear when dragging an item.

By default, the Draggable kit utilizes the "ghost" style for drop zones, but you can also choose between "shadow", "outline", and "line".

When changing the styling of your drop zones in a vertical view, please be sure to set the `direction` attribute of the `dropZone` prop to "vertical". By default, it is set to "horizontal".
