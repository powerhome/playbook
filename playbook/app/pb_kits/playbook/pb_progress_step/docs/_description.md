Progress Step kit is used to show the progress of a process. There are three types of steps in this kit: completed, active, and inactive. Completed steps are indicated by a solid, blue circle (with or without an icon). The current, or active, step is indicated by an outlined blue circle. The inactive, or future, step is indicated by a solid gray circle.
