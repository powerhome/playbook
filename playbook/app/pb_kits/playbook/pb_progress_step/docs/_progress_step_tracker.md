The `variant` prop can be set to `tracker` to achieve this UI. Tracker is only available with the horizontal orientation and it is also recommended that you set the `icon` prop to true for this variant. 

This variant takes children just like the default progress step, however, it is best to use the caption kit for children in this variant.
