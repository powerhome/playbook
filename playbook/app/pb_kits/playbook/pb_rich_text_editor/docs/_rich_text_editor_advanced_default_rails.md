This is a POC for a react-rendered-rails version of the Advanced RTE, which necessarily requires we import Tiptap as an internal dependency since it is not compatible with Rails. Because of that, I'm not sure how we will be able to truly leverage Tiptap extensions/customizability to its full potential. We should be able to provide certain props/prop combos like we do now and provide them as options for customized editors - may require a few more doc examples and methods in the controller than we currently have but once it exists should be usable (for example, if there are usecases or examples of things like horizontal bar, highlight, etc. in Nitro or documented we can build those into the kit HUB request style.)
