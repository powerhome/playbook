The Rails RichTextEditor is a React-Rendered-Rails component that uses [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) and requires the following packages to be installed in your project:

- `@tiptap/react`
- `@tiptap/starter-kit`
- `@tiptap/extension-link`

Once installed, the editor is initialized automatically when you use the component. Unlike the [React Advanced RichTextEditor](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/rich_text_editor/react#advanced-default) variant, [custom extensions](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/rich_text_editor/react#advanced-extra-extensions) are not currently supported. The doc examples below showcase some preset prop-enabled Rails RichTextEditor customizations.
