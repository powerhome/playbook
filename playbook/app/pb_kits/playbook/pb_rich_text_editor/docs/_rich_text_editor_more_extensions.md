An extension of the advanced variant, this variant allows you to leverage the `extensions` props to add as many extra extensions that you may want to the advanced editor. [Tiptap provides 53 extensions](https://tiptap.dev/extensions) that can be used with the editor. 

In order to leverage this prop, you must install the extension you need in your project, import it and pass it to the extensions array as shown in this example with the HorizontalRule extension. In order to add the extension to the editor toolbar, create an array of objects, each with icon, isActive, text and onclick values as shown in the ExtensionsList array in the example above. This array can than be passed to the `extensions` prop and all extensions in the array will be rendered in the ellipsis dropdown.
