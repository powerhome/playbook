By default, the `multi_select` prop will render selected options as the default form_pill. `form_pill_props` however can be used to customize these Pills with props that exist for the form_pill. Currently, only the '[color](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/form_pill/rails#form-pill-colors)' and '[size](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/form_pill/rails#form-pill-size)' props are supported as shown here.
