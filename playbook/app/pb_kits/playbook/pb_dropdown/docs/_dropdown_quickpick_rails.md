The `quickpick` variant provides predefined date based options when `variant:"quickpick"` is used. 

Open the Dropdown above to see the default options.

The Dropdown kit also comes with a custom event called "pb:dropdown:selected" which updates dynamically with the selection as it changes. See code snippet to see this in action.

In addition, a data attribute called data-option-selected with the selection is also rendered on the parent dropdown div.
