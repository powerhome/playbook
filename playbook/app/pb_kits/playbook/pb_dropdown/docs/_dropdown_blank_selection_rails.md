The `blank_selection` prop adds a blank option at the top of the dropdown options list. This allows users to explicitly clear their selection by choosing the blank option.

The blank selection option appears as the first item in the dropdown and has an empty value (`id: ""`, `value: ""`). When selected, it effectively clears the dropdown selection.
