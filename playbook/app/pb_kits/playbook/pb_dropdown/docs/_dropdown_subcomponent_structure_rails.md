The dropdown is built using all of the following required subcomponents:

`dropdown/dropdown_trigger` is the UI component that users interact with to toggle the dropdown. 
`dropdown/dropdown_container` is the floating container that wraps the list of dropdown options.
`dropdown/dropdown_option` renders options that are passed to the container. 
Each of these subcomponents can be altered using global props and/or their respective props. See doc examples below for more information on each.
