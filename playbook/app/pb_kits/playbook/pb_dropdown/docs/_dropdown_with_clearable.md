The `clearable` prop controls whether the clear (X) button appears in the dropdown. When set to `false`, the clear button is hidden.

This is useful in two scenarios:
1. When you have a separate "Reset" or "Defaults" button that handles clearing the selection (as shown in the Quick Pick example)
2. When you don't want to provide any way to clear the selection (as shown in the Default and Subtle examples)
