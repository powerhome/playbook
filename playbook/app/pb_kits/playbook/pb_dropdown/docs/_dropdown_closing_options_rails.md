The `close_on_click` prop allows you to control when the Dropdown closes in response to click interactions. The value `any` reflects the default behavior, where the dropdown will close after any click. Set it to `outside` to ensure interactive elements as dropdown options are able to be interacted with or modified. Set it to `inside` for a dropdown that only closes when the input or dropdown menu is clicked.
