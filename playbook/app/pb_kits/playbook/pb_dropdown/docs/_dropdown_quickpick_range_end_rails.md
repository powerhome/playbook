The optional `range_ends_today` prop can be used with the `quickpick` variant to set end date on all ranges that start with 'this' to today's date. For instance, by default 'This Year' will set end day to 12/31/(current year), but if `range_ends_today` prop is used, end date on that range will be today's date.
