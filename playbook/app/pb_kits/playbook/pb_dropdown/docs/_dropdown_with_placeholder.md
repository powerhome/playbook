The `placeholder` prop allows you to customize the placeholder text that appears when no option is selected in the dropdown.

The placeholder prop works with all dropdown variants (`default`, `subtle`, and `quickpick`). When no option is selected, the placeholder text is displayed. When an option is selected, the placeholder is replaced by the selected option's label. The default placeholder text is "Select..." if no placeholder is provided.
