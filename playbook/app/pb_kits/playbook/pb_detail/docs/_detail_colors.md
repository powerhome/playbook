##### Prop

This kit uses the `light` color by default, and can be replaced with colors below:

`default` `lighter` `link` `error` `success`

These colors are not for standard usage. You can use the `color` prop to make fixes if colors are not appearing properly, but consult your UX team members if you are deciding to implement it.
