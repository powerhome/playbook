The full height dialog is centered by default, but the placement can changed via `placement` prop with one of the following values: `left`, `center`, `right`.

The `large` variant will allways be centered even sending a preferred placement.

All dialogs with the `fullHeight` prop will be displayed full-width on mobile screens.
