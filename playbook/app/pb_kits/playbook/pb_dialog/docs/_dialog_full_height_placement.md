The full height dialog is centered by default, but the placement can be changed via the `placement` prop with one of the following values: `left`, `center`, `right`.

The `large` variant however will always be centered, even if the `placement` prop is used.

All dialogs with the `fullHeight` prop will be displayed full-width on mobile screens.
