The dialog will create a scroll container automatically when the text exceeds the height of the page. No prop or configuration is needed. 

When such a scroll container is created, the dialog header will remain fixed at top of dialog and not scroll with the body content.

If the dialog is a  `fullHeight` variant, the header and footer will both be sticky and not scroll with the body content.
