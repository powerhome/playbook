For the Rails version of the dialog kit, the clickable element being used to open the dialog must be given a `open-dialog` data attribute with a value that is the same as the id being given to the dialog itself. See code example below to see this in action.

Additionally, both the cancel button and the confirm button have optional id props which can be used to pass in a custom id to allow developers to target that button with custom javascript if needed (`confirm_button_id` and `cancel_button_id`).
