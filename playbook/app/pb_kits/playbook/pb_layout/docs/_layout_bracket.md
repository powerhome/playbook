Use `<Layout.RoundLabel>`, `<Layout.Round>`, and `<Layout.Game>` to make a bracket layout.

On mobile devices, `<Layout.RoundLabel>` will display (on desktop these components are hidden) and the bracket will be in one column.

Ensure that each `<Layout.Game>` maintains a consistent height for the bracket lines to lay out properly.
