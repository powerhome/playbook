The `reaction` variant is an additional variant supported by the Button kit. This variant allows the user to pass in any HTML Emoji or it's hexa/decimal ref (see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp)) as a string to the `icon` prop. If nothing is passed to the icon prop, the default reaction button will be displayed as seen in the third example.

The reaction button also provides two additional (optional) props: `count`, which allows users to pass in a number to be displayed next to the Emoji and `highlight` which is a boolean that if true, displays the 'active' state for the button. Click the first reaction button to see this in action!
