The `reaction` variant accepts any HTML Emoji or it's hexa/decimal ref (see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp)) as a string within the `icon` prop. If nothing is passed to the icon prop, the default reaction button will be displayed as seen in the third example.

Reaction buttons also accept two additional (optional) props: `count`, which accepts a number (i.e., a count of reactions) to be displayed next to the Emoji; and `highlight`, which is a boolean that if true, displays the 'active' state for the button. Click the first reaction button to see this in action!
