Various plugins are available for use with MapLibre, one of which is the [mapbox-gl-draw](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw). This plugin is recommended by MapLibre if you need to add the functionality of drawing polygons on the map.

To test this tool:
- Click the "draw box" icon to activate the polygon tool
- Click on a spot on the map to start drawing
- Continue clicking to create new points, defining the boundaries of the polygon
- Press enter or re-click the first point to finish the polygon
- Once drawn, polygons can be selected on click and then moved, by dragging-and-dropping the entire shape; resized, by dragging-and-dropping any boundary point(s); or deleted, by clicking the "trash" button.
