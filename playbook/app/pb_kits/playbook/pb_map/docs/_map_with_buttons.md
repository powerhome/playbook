Various plugins are available for use with MapLibre, one of which is the [mapbox-gl-draw](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw) which allows for drawing of polygons on the map. Click on the polygon draw button to activiate, click on a position on the map to start drawing and click again to create the polygon. Once drawn, polygon can be moved or deleted as well. 

The above example also shows how custom buttons can be added to the map. The last button on the right will snap focus and zoom back to the originally set values when clicked. To see it in action, scroll away from the marker or zoom in or out. Now clikc the button and watch the map revert to original position. This functionality makes use of the [FlyTo](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/map/#map#flyto) props provided by Maplibre.
