Various plugins are available for use with MapLibre, one of which is the [mapbox-gl-draw](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw) which allows for drawing of polygons on the map. Click on the polygon draw button to activiate, click on a position on the map to start drawing and click again to create the polygon. Once drawn, polygon can be moved or deleted as well.
