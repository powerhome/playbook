Optionally add a second yAxis to support secondary datasets (e.x., a spline) by passing `yAxis: 1` to the second node of your `chartData` array. 

To customize the format and/or title of your secondary yAxis, pass your desired values as arrays through the `axisFormat` and `axisTitle` props, respectively.
