In addition to font and spacing props, the Collapsible Nav variant has access to two additional props: 
 
`collapsibleTrail`/`collapsible_trail` prop can be used to add the vertical line to the left of the nested navItems.

`iconRight` for the collapsible Nav allows you to customize your icon sets by passing it an array of any comma-separated pair of icon values. The first icon value will replace the kit's default icon when collapsed (chevron-down), and the second value will replace the default icon when expanded (chevron-up). `iconRight` also allows you to pass it a single icon as a string, in which case the icon will not toggle with the collapsible state.
