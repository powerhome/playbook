The collapsible nav kit uses our Collapsible kit under the hood and as such the `useCollapsible` hook can be used to achieve custom toggling of the collapsible nav. To do this, you must import and declare the `useCollapsible` hook and pass it's state to the `collapsed` prop. See our code example below to see how this can be done.
