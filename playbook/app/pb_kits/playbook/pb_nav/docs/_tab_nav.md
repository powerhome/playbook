The Nav kit can also be used to create dynamic tabbing. To do so, use the boolean `tabbing` prop as shown here. 

All divs you want to use as tabs MUST have an id attached to them. To link the tab to the nav, use the required data attribute `pb_nav_item_tab` on each nav/item and pass it the id of the tab you want linked to that specific nav/item. See code example below to see this in action.
