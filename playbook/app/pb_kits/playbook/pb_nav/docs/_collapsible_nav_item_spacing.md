The `itemSpacing` prop can optionally be applied to the `Nav` parent element and accepts an object through which any of our [Spacing](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/visual_guidelines/spacing) (padding, margin) global prop values can be passed as an object. All spacing values passed to `itemSpacing` will be applied to all navItems within the nav. Spacing (padding, margin) global props can still be used on nested navItems in conjunction with `itemSpacing` on the Nav for customized control. Any Spacing (padding,margin) global props applied directly to a navItem will override any competing `itemSpacing` value.
