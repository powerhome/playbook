To gain greater control over the font styles in the navItems, devs have access to two additional props:

`fontSize`/`font_size` prop can be used to set navItem text to `small` or `normal` (`normal` by default)

`fontWeight`/`font_weight` prop can be used to set navItem text to `bold`, `bolder` or `regular` (`regular` by default)
