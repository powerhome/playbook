Create a sticky header that works for responsive Advanced Tables by setting `sticky: true` via `tableProps` and giving the AdvancedTable a `maxHeight` using our [Max Height](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/visual_guidelines/max_height) global prop. The header is sticky within the table container, which allows for header stickiness and responsive first column stickiness to work in harmony on smaller screen sizes (expand some rows on the table above with a smaller window size to see this in action).

For a sticky header on a nonresponsive Advanced Table (`responsive="none"`), set `sticky: true` via `tableProps` but do not set a `maxHeight`. The table header will remain fixed in place when the user scrolls up and down on the page.
