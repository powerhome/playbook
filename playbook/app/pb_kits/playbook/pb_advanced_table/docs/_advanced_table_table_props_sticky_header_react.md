Create a sticky header that works for responsive and nonresponsive Advanced Tables by setting `sticky: true` via `tableProps` and giving the AdvancedTable a `maxHeight` using our [Max Height](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/visual_guidelines/max_height) global prop. The header is sticky within the table container, which allows for header stickiness and responsive first column stickiness to work in harmony on smaller screen sizes (expand some rows on the table above with a smaller window size to see this in action).
