This kit uses the [Table kit](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/table) under the hood which comes with it's own set of props. If you want to apply certain Table props to that underlying kit, you can do so by using the optional `table_props` prop. This prop must be an object that contains valid Table props. For a full list of Table props, see [here](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/table).
