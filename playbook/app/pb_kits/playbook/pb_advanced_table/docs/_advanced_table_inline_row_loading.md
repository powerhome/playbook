As a default, the kit assumes that the initial dataset is complete, and it renders all expansion buttons/controls based on that data; if no children are present, no expansion controls are rendered. If, however, you want to change the initial dataset to omit some or all of its children (to improve load times of a complex dataset, perhaps), and you implement a querying logic that loads children only when its parent is expanded, then you must use the `inlineRowLoading` prop to ensure your expansion controls are rendered even though your child data is not yet loaded. You must also pass an empty `children` array to any node that will have children to ensure its parent maintains its ability to expand. If this prop is called AND your data contains empty `children` arrays, the kit will render expansion controls on any row with empty children, and then add an inline loading state within the expanded subrow until those child row(s) are returned to the page [by your query logic].

In this code example, 2021 has an empty children array. Toggle it open to see the inline loading state. Once the correct data loads, this state will be replaced with the correct data rows. 

This prop is set to `false` by default.
