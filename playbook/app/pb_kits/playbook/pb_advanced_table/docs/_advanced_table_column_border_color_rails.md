The borders of column groups can be set to a different color using the `column_group_border_color` prop. In order for these borders to be visible, this prop must be used with `table_props` and `vertical_border` set to true.

The available colors for the border are Playbook's Text Colors, which can be found [here](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/visual_guidelines/colors).
