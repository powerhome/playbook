Inline Cell Editing can be achieved with a combination of our `TextInput` kit and the `customRenderer` method available through columnDefinitions. 

Hover over any cell within the 'Scheduled Meetings' column to see the TextInput and type in to change values. Values can be saved by clicking away from the TextInput or by hitting 'Enter'.
See the code snippet below to see how this was achieved. Devs must manage state themselves as shown.
