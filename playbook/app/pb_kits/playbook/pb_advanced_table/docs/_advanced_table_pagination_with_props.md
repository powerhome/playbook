`paginationProps` is an optional prop that can be used to further customize pagination for the AdvancedTable. This prop is an object with the following optional items:

- `pageIndex`: An optional prop to set which page is set to open on initial load. Default is '0'
- `pageSize`: An optional prop to set total number of rows for each page before the Table paginates. Default is '20'
- `range`: The range prop determines how many pages to display in the Pagination component. Regardless of this value, the first two and last two pages are always visible to facilitate navigation to the beginning and end of the pagination. If these always-visible pages fall within the specified range, they are included in the display. If they fall outside the range, the pagination will show additional pages up to the number defined by the range prop. See [here for more details](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/pagination/react#default). Default is set to '5'
- `onPageChange`: A callback function that gives to access to the current page index.
