The Advanced Table also allows for rendering custom components within individual Cells. To achieve this, you can make use of the optional `customRenderer` item within each columnDefinition. This function gives you access to the current Cell's value if you just want to use that with a custom Kit, but it also gives you access to the entire `row` object. The row object provides all data for the current row. To access the data, use `row.original` which is the entire data object for the current row. See the code snippet below for 3 separate use cases and how they were acheived.
