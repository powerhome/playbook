The borders of column groups can be set to a different color using the `columnGroupBorderColor` prop. By default, these borders will use the default color set for table borders.

The available colors for the border are Playbook's Text Colors, which can be found [here](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/visual_guidelines/colors).
