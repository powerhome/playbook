The borders of column groups can be set to a different color using the `columnGroupBorderColor` prop.  In order for these borders to be visible, this prop must be used with `tableProps` and `verticalBorder` set to true.

The available colors for the border are Playbook's Text Colors, which can be found [here](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/tokens/colors).
