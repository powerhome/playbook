# Advanced Table Kit Data Structure

The AdvancedTable Kit's `tableData` prop consumes the data that will render the table and as such has a specific structure. It must be an array of objects, where the key/value pairs will become the values rendered within each column. If children are present, they must also take the form of an array of objects. The kit will automatically render `children` as subRows.

Here is the data structure being used within the kits doc examples:
