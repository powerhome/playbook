Our Icon kit allows integration with [FontAwesome's custom kit](https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs/web/setup/use-kit#contentHeader) functionality out-of-the-box. 

All you need to do is 3 things:
1) Import your custom-icon.js file as outlined in the FontAwesome docs.
2) Use our fontStyle prop called "fak" so that our Icon component knows you are using a "fa-kit" icon. 
3) Pass in your FaKit name as a string to our icon prop (This is the name that you designated when you uploaded the icon on their site).
