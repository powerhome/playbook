The Lightbox kit is a popup window overlay that will appear on top of your webpage and cover the entirety of the screen. It can be used to display a group of images that the user can swipe through, zoom into and view. The button in the top left of the header can be used to close the overlay and exit back to your webpage. Click the images in the examples below to see Lightbox in action.
