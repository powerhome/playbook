Optionally build your table with divs by passing `div` to the `tag` prop of all* your sub-components. 

*NOTE: The `tag` prop defaults to `table`, which returns html elements.  If divs are desired, sub-components must be used and all table elements, including the initial kit call, must use `div` as their `tag` in order for the table to render properly.
