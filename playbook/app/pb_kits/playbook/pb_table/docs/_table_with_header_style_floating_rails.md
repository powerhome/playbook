Further customize your header by using the [table with background kit](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/table/rails#table-with-background-kit) logic to give your table header a custom background color. Use the `header_style: "floating"` prop to visually nest the borderless table within a card or collapsible with a matching background color (the `background_color` passed to Background kit should match the `background` or `background_color` for the element in which it is nested).
