Customize your header by removing the header borders with the `header_style: "borderless"` prop.
Further customize your header by using the [table with background kit](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/table#table-with-background-kit) logic to give your table header a custom background color. Use the `header_style: "borderless_nested"` prop to visually nest the borderless table within a card or collapsible with a matching background color (the `background_color` passed to Background kit should match the `background_color` for the element in which it is nested).
Note: if you are using the `vertical_border` table prop to add vertical borders, we recommend using the [Sub Component with Table Elements](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/table#table-with-sub-components-table-elements) version of the kit in order to avoid having these vertical borders infiltrate the borderless header.
