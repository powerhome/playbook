Pass our `verticalAlign` / `vertical_align` global prop to any `table.cell` / `table/table_cell` subcomponent to change the text alignment of individual cells, or apply this prop persistently to align entire columns.
The first table shifts "Total" down, whereas the second table shifts the "Espresso Drinks" column contents up.
