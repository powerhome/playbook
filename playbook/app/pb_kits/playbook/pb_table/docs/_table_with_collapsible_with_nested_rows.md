The `collapsibleContent` can display any content, including nested Table Rows. 

Additionally, the `collapsibleSideHighlight` can also be removed by setting it to false if needed. This prop is set to true by default. 

**NOTE**: We advise against using the `disableHover` Table prop when nesting Table Rows within a Table.
