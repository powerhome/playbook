Further customize your header by using the [table with background kit](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/table/react#table-with-background-kit) logic to give your table header a custom background color. Use the `headerStyle="floating"` prop to visually nest the borderless table within a card or collapsible with a matching background color (the `backgroundColor` passed to Background kit should match the `background` or `backgroundColor` for the element in which it is nested).
