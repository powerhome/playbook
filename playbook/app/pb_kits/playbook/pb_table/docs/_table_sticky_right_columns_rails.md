The `sticky_right_column` prop works in the same way as the above `sticky_left_column` prop. It expects an array of the column ids you want to be sticky. Make sure to add the corresponding id to the `<th>` and `<td>`.

Please ensure that unique ids are used for all columns across multiple tables. Using the same columns ids on multiple tables can lead to issues when using the `sticky_right_column` prop.
