Customize your header by removing the header borders with the `headerStyle="borderless"` prop.
Further customize your header by using the [table with background kit](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/table/react#table-with-background-kit) logic to give your table header a custom background color. Use the `headerStyle="borderlessNested"` prop to visually nest the borderless table within a card or collapsible with a matching background color (the `backgroundColor` passed to Background kit should match the `backgroundColor` for the element in which it is nested).
Note: if you are using the `verticalBorder` table prop to add vertical borders, we recommend using the [Sub Component with Table Elements](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/kits/table/react#table-with-sub-components-table-elements) version of the kit in order to avoid having these vertical borders infiltrate the borderless header.
