The `collapsible` prop can be used on any Table Row to add a collapsible area. Use the additional `collapsible_content` prop to add any content to the collapsible Row.
Please be aware that you will need to pass in an `id` to any table rows you want to be collapsible. Make sure every `id` is unique if you are using multipe collapsibles.

Follow this example to make the icons dynamic to the state of the collapsible.
