Simply enter the timezone you would like to use and it will appear.

The list of supported timezones is exhaustive and we're most likely to only use timezones from the Americas so we've highlighted those in the examples.

However, if you need to support another timezone you should be able to Google a specific list, otherwise you can follow the string pattern and try entering a continent and a city.

Remember, this is just labeling the timezone, please verify the actual time for a specified timezone is rendering properly. 

Format: `<Continent>/<Large_City_Name>`

Continent Options: ` America | Europe | Asia | Africa | Pacific | India | Atlantic | Australia `
