Highcharts provides many options for customizing the legend display. This example showcases the following:

`align` can be used to align the legend left, right or center (defaults to center)

`verticalAlign` can be used to place the legend above the graph. Options are top, middle, bottom with default set to bottom

`layout` determines the position of the legend items. Options are horizontal, vertical or proximate with default set to horizontal `layout: proximate` will place the legend items as close as possible to the graphs they're representing. It will also determine whether to place the legend above/below or on the side of the plot area, if the legend is in a corner.

`x` offsets the legend relative to its horizontal alignment. Negative x moves it to the left, positive x moves it to the right (defaults to 0)

`y` offsets the legend relative to its vertical alignment. Negative y moves it up, positive y moves it down (defaults to 0)
