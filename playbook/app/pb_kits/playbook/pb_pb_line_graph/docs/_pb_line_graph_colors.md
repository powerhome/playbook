Custom data colors allow for color customization to match the needs of business requirements.

For React, import 'colors' from Playbook, then set custom colors in the colors array using the desired color variables. Hex colors are also available.

For Rails, POC#2: Access color tokens from the generated JSON using either hash-style or method-style syntax, for example `Playbook::Tokens.colors[:data_4]` or `Playbook::Tokens.colors.data_4`.
