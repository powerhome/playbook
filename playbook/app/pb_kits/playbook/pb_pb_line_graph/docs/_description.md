This kit is a wrapper around the Highcharts library. It applies styling and default settings but does NOT ship Highcharts. In order to use this kit, 'highcharts' and 'highcharts-react-official' must be installed in your repo. Once done, any prop or functionality provided by Highcharts can be used with this kit without requiring specifc props from Playbook. The doc examples below showcase a few common usecases but are not a comprehensive list of all the functionalities possible. 

See the [highcharts API docs](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/) for a comprehensive look at what is possible.
