By default, Highcharts have a height of 400px, but this can be customized. You can override the default by specifying either a percentage or a fixed pixel value.

Using a percentage maintains a consistent aspect ratio across different responsive sizes. For example, setting the height to 50% makes the chartâ€™s height half of its width.
