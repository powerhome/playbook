The `collapsed` prop allows you to toggle the collapsible with external controls (like buttons) when used in conjunction with our `useCollapsible` hook.
 
NOTE: you must import and declare the `useCollapsible` hook then pass its state to the collapsed prop of any Collapsible you wish to manage with the external control. See our code example for details.
