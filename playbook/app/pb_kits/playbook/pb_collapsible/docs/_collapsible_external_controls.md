The `collapsed` prop is a boolean prop that is set to 'true' by default. If set to 'false', the collapsible will be rendered toggled open on page load.

The Collapsible also exposes functionality that allows you to use an external control like a button to toggle the collapsible. Do do this, you must use a unique id on the collapsible/collapsible_content child kit. You can then attach an eventListner to the external control of your choice, pass it the id as an argument and use `document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(id))` to hook up the functionality. To see this in action, see the code example below.
