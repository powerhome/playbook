When using a custom Main Section, you can also use the optional `Collapsible.Icon`.

__NOTE__: The optional icon subcomponent must receive the `collapsed` state of the collapsible in order to toggle correctly. It also accepts all icon-related props (`icon`, `size`, and `color`) for further customization. If none of these are specified, the default icon will be rendered.
