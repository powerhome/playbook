The `mainFlexItem` prop allows you to pass any of the 'flex' values to the Collapsible which will allow the Collapsible.Main to fill the entire space of the containing div instead of being restricted by the size of it's contents. The default value is 'none'. The first example above sets `mainFlexItem` to '1'.
