Optionally replace your `Collapsible.Main` with any component to customize your Main section's contents and/or style. This gives you full control over that subcomponent. For example, here we are using global props to make that custom Main 'sticky' on scroll.

__NOTE__: Custom main sections requires the `useCollapsible` hook to ensure the collapsible's toggle action works correctly.
