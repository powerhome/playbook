Use variant `elapsed` to show time ago. This variant can be customized in several ways:

Use the optional `showUser`/`show_user` prop to show user as part of the text. When showing the user, pass in the user name using the `text` prop as shown. `showUser`/`show_user` is set to false by default. 

Use the optional `hideUpdated`/`hide_updated` prop to hide the 'Last updated' text if needed.
