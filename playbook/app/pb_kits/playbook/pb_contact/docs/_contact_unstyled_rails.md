Use the Contact kit with `icon_enabled: false` and `unstyled: true` to display phone numbers with full typography control. When `unstyled: true`, the Contact kit renders just the formatted text without a Body wrapper, allowing you to wrap it in your own Typography kit to control the color and styling.
