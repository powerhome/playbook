Lists display a vertical set of related content.

 **Layout Prop**
 
 - Setting the `layout` prop to either `left` or `right` creates a 2 column layout on the the list/item kit. This is useful if you need 2 things on the same line in a list.
 - Using `layout:'left'` will make the first column shrink and the second column grow and align to the left.
 - Using `layout:'right'` will make the first column grow and push the second column to the right.
