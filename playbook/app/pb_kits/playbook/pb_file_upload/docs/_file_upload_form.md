Leverage the `input_options` global prop in order to make the `id` for the File Upload and the existing input you are choosing to wrap with our Kit with match each other, which is a requirement. This will ensure that the click on the button a.k.a, the underlying label's `for`, triggers the File Upload. 

This example shows a functioning upload within a form group (be sure to remove `method: :get`) using `input_options` to connect `name` to File Upload's `id` (`id` is outside of `input_options` so that both "Upload File" secondary button and the "No file chosen" text area pop up the finder window). A dev can check the console to see it logging their file prior to submission with the event listener.
