Highcharts allows for any custom colors to be used. Custom data colors allow for color customization to match the needs of business requirements.

For React, pass the option `plotOptions.solidgauge.borderColor` with a Playbook token like `colors.` + `data_1 | data_2 | data_3 | data_4 | data_5 | data_6 | data_7 | data_8`. HEX colors are also available `eg: #CA0095`

For Rails, the option `plotOptions.solidgauge.borderColor` can only be used with HEX values as shown.
