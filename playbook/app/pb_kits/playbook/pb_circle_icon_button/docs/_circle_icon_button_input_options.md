Use the `input_options` prop to pass additional attributes directly to the internal Playbook Button component. While the wrapper div has access to the standard `data` prop from KitBase, `input_options` allows you to attach attributes specifically to the internal button element.

This is particularly useful when you need data attributes or other HTML attributes to apply to the button itself.
