The `link` prop accepts a string that is used as an href value and causes the button to act as a link. The default behavior of a link is to open in the current window. You can optionally alter the link behavior by adding the `newWindow` prop (boolean), which will open the link in a new window, or by calling the `target` prop, which accepts `_self`, `_blank`, `_parent`, `_top`, `child`, or any string, allowing you to specify any link target.
