The `requiredIndicator`/`required_indicator` prop displays a red asterisk (*) next to the label, visually indicating that the field is required. This is purely visual and does not enforce validation. 

You can use `requiredIndicator`/`required_indicator` with any validation approach: HTML5 validation via the `required` prop, client-side validation, or backend validation. For this reason, it works independently and doesn't need to be paired with the `required` prop.
