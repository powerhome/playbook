The MultiLevelSelect kit renders a multi leveled select dropdown based on data from the user. `treeData` is a required prop that is expected to contain the data in the form of an array of objects. See code snippet for an example data array.

The `selectedData` prop returns an array of all checked items, irrespective of whether it is a parent, child or grandchild. Open the console on this example and check and uncheck checkboxes to see this is action!
