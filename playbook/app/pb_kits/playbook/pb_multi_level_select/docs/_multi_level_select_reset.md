In order to clear the multilevelselect selection using an external trigger (like a reset button), the `clearMultiLevelSelect` function can be used. See the code snippet below to see this in action. The function is scoped by id so an id MUST be used on the multilevelselect kit and passed to the function as shown for it to work.
