Use the `inputDisplay`/`input_display` prop to optionally display only the count in the display as opposed to multiple pills. This prop is set to 'pills' by default.

**NOTE**: `inputDisplay`/`input_display` is particularly useful for larger trees that may return many pill selections, helping to keep the input field clean and compact.
