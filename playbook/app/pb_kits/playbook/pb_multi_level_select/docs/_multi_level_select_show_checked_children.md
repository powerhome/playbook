If you wish to control the auto-expansion of nodes with descendants in your multi-level select, you can utilize `showCheckedChildren/show_checked_children`. This prop (set to 'true' by default) controls whether items will be expanded when opening the select, regardless of if there are any items currently selected.

The prop will still honor any `expanded` attribute set up within your tree data.
