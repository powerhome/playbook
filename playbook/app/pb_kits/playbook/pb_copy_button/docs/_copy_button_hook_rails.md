You can use any external control (like the text itself or an icon) to copy. To use this hook, set the `data-external-copy-from` attribute on the external control to the copying ID. This will grab the `innerText` from `your_id` element, or `value` if it is an input element. Alternatively, you can set a `data-external-copy-value` attribute and copy custom text.

See the code example for details.
