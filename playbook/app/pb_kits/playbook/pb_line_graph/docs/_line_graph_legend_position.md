The Line Graph kit has 5 props that will affect the position of the legend.
`align`: Horizontal alignment. Will accept `left | center | right` as props. The default is `center`.
`verticalAlign`: Vertical alignment. Will accept `top | middle | bottom` as props. The default is `middle`.
`layout`: The orientation of the legend items. Will accept `horizontal | vertical | proximate` as props. This will also determine whether to place it above/below or on the side of the plot area, if the legend is in a corner. The default is `horizontal`. `proximate` will place the legend items as close as possible to the graphs they're representing.
`x`: Offsets the legend relative to its horizontal alignmnet. Negative x moves it to the left, positive x moves it to the right. Will accept any numerical value. Default is `0`.
`y`: Offsets the legend relative to its vertical alignmnet. Negative y moves it up, positive y moves it down. Will accept any numerical value. Default is `0`.
