Section separator is a divider line that compartmentalizes content, typically used on cards or white backgrounds.

To ensure that the section separator is properly rendered, please be sure to use our global  `width` prop to set width to 100%. [See here](https://playbook.powerapp.cloud/visual_guidelines/width) for more information on the global width prop.
