Pass "primary" to the `color` prop to change any section separator color.

**NOTE:** Passing `children` overrides any content provided via the `text` prop. The `color` prop does not affect the `text` prop's color, and the color of `children` is determined by the children's individual props. For greater control over text color customization, consider using a separator with `children`.
