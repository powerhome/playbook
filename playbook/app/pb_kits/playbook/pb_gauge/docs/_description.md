**Important Note for the React Kit**: In order to leverage this kit, you must install `highcharts` and `highcharts-react-official` into your project as shown below. To then apply Playbook styles to your Highchart, import gaugeTheme.ts from playbook-ui and merge it with your Highchart options. Then, pass the merged value to the options prop. Playbookâ€™s styling will be applied automatically. See the examples in the documentation below.
