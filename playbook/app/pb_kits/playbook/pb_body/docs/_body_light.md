##### Prop
This kit uses `default` color by default, and can be replaced with colors below:

* `light` `lighter` `success` `error` `link`

- These colors are not for standard usage. You can use the color prop to make fixes if colors are not appearing properly, but consult your UX team members if you are deciding to implement it
