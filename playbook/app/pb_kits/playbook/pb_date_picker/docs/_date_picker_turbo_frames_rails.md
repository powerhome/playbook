The `custom_event_type` prop allows you to specify a custom event that will trigger the date picker's initialization, in addition to the default initialization on `DOMContentLoaded`. This is particularly useful in dynamic contexts like Turbo Frame updates where you need to reinitialize the date picker after new content loads. For Turbo integration, use `custom_event_type: "turbo:before-render"` to ensure the date picker properly reinitializes after Turbo navigation events. 

In this example, we demonstrate the setup pattern by connecting a button to dispatch a "datePickerLoader" event - while the date picker's event listener is properly configured through the `custom_event_type` prop, this demo only logs the event dispatch to the console to illustrate the connection structure.
