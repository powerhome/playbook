The Skeleton Loading kit can be used an intermediate loading state to give users a visual indication that content is loading. 

**Please Note**: this kit is not meant to be integrated interally within other Playbook kits as a loading prop; rather, it can be used to create a composite of the section/kit/page with loading intermediataries, as demonstrated in the the "example component" doc examples.
