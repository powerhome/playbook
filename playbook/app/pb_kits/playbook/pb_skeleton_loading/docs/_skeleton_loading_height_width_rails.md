The `height` and `width` props accept pixel and percentage values. If using a percentage for `height`, the parent container must have a set height.

Set the `height` and `width` props to the same value to make a square. A `rounded` border_radius will make a square a circle. If using percentages to make a square, your parent container must also be a square.
