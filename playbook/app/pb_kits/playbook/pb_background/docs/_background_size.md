Background size can be passed into the background kit. Values `auto`, `cover`, and `contain` are accepted. 

ðŸ’¡ *Note:* When using `contain` you might not want to have a repeating background as this will not always look pleasant. To prevent this, you may pass `no-repeat` to the `backgroundRepeat` prop.
